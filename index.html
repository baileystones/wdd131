                <p>Hello, my name is Bailey! I am from Queen Creek, Arizona, and am currently up in Rexburg for school. This is my sixth semester and I am studying software engineering. I changed my major fairly recently, so I have a ton to learn but I love this field of study. In my free time I enjoy reading, skiing, and volleyball.</p>

            <p>I come from a huge volleyball family. That's how my parents met! My mom played collegiately and professionally, my parents have coached a majority of their life, and me and all my siblings have played club volleyball since we were tiny.</p>
            
            <p>Last summer, my sister committed to play Division 1 volleyball for Kansas-State University. Go Wildcats! I love watching any volleyball I can get and spending time on the court with my friends and family.
